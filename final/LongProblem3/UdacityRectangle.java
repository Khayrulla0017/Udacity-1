// The Rectangle in the graphics package we have been using this 
// semester is limited because it can not calculate its area.
//
// Create a class UdacityRectagle that extends Rectangle and
// adds an area() method which returns an int
//
// This class will not need to provide any new instance variables,
// but it will need a constructor which takes x, y corordinates and
// width and height. That is provided for you
// 
// A RectangleDemo class is included on a different tab. This may give you some hints.
